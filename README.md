Milestone Project 1 redo

Bad Company Roleplaygroup

I am the dungeon master of a newly formed roleplay group. Seen as our groups makes a lot of stories up themselves and do not use content exclusive to Dungeons
and Dragons, the group and I wanted to share parts of our stories with the world. Maybe eventually even follow in the footsteps of great content creators like
Critical Role.

For that end, I pitched the idea of a website for the group. Where all the content we create, we can eventually also share with the world.

I simplified my design and overal look to get a different look and also an easier to make website. 
Because of hectic worklife and personal life I had a lot of time constraints.

UX
As a visitor, I want to read about the world the players are playing on, so I read up on the stories.
As a visitor, I want to be able to be able to see what is available on the website, so I can find the information I want as quick as possible.
As a visitor, I want to be able to use the homebrew content the players use, so I can enhance my own gameplay options.

Features
Articles about the worlds we create and the party travels through.
Information about the players and their characters. Eventually also the Livestream information where people can watch and listen to our stories.

Existing Features
Feature 1 - A simple homepage where the visitor can find the most interesting parts at the drop of a hat.
Feature 2 - An article of background information about the world of Nephalyr. To get there, the visitor clicks on Lore -> clicks on Nephalyr.
Feature 3 - An article about the background of the other world called Chavu'Nal. To get there, the visitor clicks on Lore -> clicks on Chavu'Nal.

Features Left to Implement
A contact page.
A Homebrew page.
A Characters page.
A Information page of the players.
A slider highlighting a few of the articles on the homepage.
Maybe a webshop for merchandise.
A page linking to the livestream.

Testing
Go to the "Lore" page.
Try to read the article about Nephalyr by clicking on the arrow underneath Nephalyr.
Try to read it in a smaller screen to see if the article changes with the screen size.
Go back to the "Lore" page by clicking on the link next to the article.
Try to read the article about Chavu'Nal.
Go back to the home page by clicking on Bad Company.

Go to the "Character" page.
Try reading about the characters in different screen sizes.

Try the home page in different screen sizes.

Deployment
Using PHPStorm together with GitHub I could make commits strait from my IDE.
Via Bootstrap Studio I could host what I made fairly easy.
Together with Heroku.
